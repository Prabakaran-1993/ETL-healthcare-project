/*This procedure cleans up the text in clinical reports by:

 Removing carriage returns (CHAR(13)) and line breaks (CHAR(10))

Replacing double spaces with single spaces

âœ…Ensuring the report text is more readable and standardized before migration or reporting

This kind of transformation is especially useful when:

You're replicating reports in RDLC or Power BI

You need consistent formatting across legacy systems

You're preparing data for downstream analytics or archiving*/
