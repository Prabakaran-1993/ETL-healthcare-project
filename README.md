Simulated ETL pipeline based on real-world healthcare data migration experience.
# Healthcare Data Migration – ETL Simulation

This project simulates a healthcare data migration and archival workflow inspired by my role as a Technology Lead at Triyam Information Technology, where I led ETL development for US-based hospitals and clinics.

## 🏥 Project Background
The goal of this project is to demonstrate key components of a real-world healthcare data migration pipeline, including:
- Extracting EHR/EMR data from legacy systems
- Transforming and validating patient-level clinical data
- Loading into secure cloud-based platforms

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Azure Data Factory (ADF)
- SQL Server
- Python (for automation and web scraping)
- Excel (Power Query Editor)
- Power BI
- RDLC Report Viewer
- WinAutomation

## 🔍 Key Features
- ETL pipeline development using ADF and SQL
- Metadata extraction automation via Python scripts
- Patient document mapping and validation
- Report replication using RDLC
- Excel-based preprocessing and rule-based validation
- Automated deployment and QA support

## 📊 Data Types Handled
- Electronic Health Records (EHR)
- Electronic Medical Records (EMR)
- Patient demographics
- Clinical reports
- Lab results
- Visit summaries

## 🏆 Achievements Reflected
- 30% reduction in ETL runtime through SQL optimization
- Streamlined document mapping via Python automation
- Improved reporting accuracy with RDLC replication
- Robust validation logic for data integrity

## 👨‍💻 About Me
Technology Lead with 3+ years of experience in Healthcare IT and data migration. Currently upskilling in Data Analytics with a focus on Power BI and Python to deliver impactful insights.
